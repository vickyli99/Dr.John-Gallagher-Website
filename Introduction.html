                <p class="tab" style="font-family:verdana">
	&emsp;&emsp; How writing studies understands itself has been a long-standing point of inquiry for the “dappled discipline” (Lauer, 1984). From Albert Kitzhaber’s study of 19th century teaching traditions (1990) to Connors’s (1984) and Hesse’s (2019) taxonomies of writing studies journals, the field has a vested interest in debating the politics and values that emerge from the field’s trends and trajectories. Hermeneutic taxonomies were crucial in the 1980s and 1990s to the maturation of writing studies as a sanctioned discipline in higher education. These extensive taxonomies were and are useful for understanding social debates of those times (e.g., North, 1987).  </p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">
&emsp;&emsp; More recently, writing studies researchers have expanded methods into social science inquiries about how the field writes and performs its research. Citational politics, i.e., who is cited and why, has been a recent interest, buttressed by data-driven findings about the long tail of citations in writing studies (Mueller, 2012). Others have sought to categorize doctoral dissertations in Composition based around author geography, methods deployed, and content analysis (Miller, 2014). This work was preceded by Hyland’s (2003) examination of dissertation acknowledgments from six different fields outside writing studies (pp. 247–248). While these investigations have examined paratextual aspects of research articles, e.g., references (Mueller, 2012) and abstracts (Miller, 2014), analyzing the main body of research articles is necessary to extend previous empirical claims about how writing studies researchers officiallyi write. Dylan Dryer (2019) addressed this avenue by examining 1,848 articles across twelve writing studies journals. Dryer discusses keywords from a corpus linguistics perspective, arguing, ultimately, that certain keywords can expose researchers in writing studies to epistemological blind spots about the multiplicity of keyword meanings.ii We propose a similar method to analyze the body of the article. </p>

<p style="font-family:verdana">
&emsp;&emsp; In this article, we expand upon these methodological approaches using a corpus linguistics and statistical approach to analyze a 20-year segment (2000–2019) of the ways in which large-scale, and therefore latent, writing habits or patterns exist in writing studies journals. We examine approximately 99% of the research articlesiii from College Composition and Communication (CCC), College English (CE), Computers and Composition (C&C), Research in the Teaching of English (RTE), Rhetoric Review (RR), Rhetoric Society Quarterly (RSQ), and Written Communication (WC). We present three types of statistical averages: (a) word count averages per journal article along with sentence length averages (and standard deviation) by journal; (b) single keyword, bi-grams, and tri-grams (two- and three-word sequences) along with word frequencies; and (c) citational analysis of the journal articles, including number of references per article and the relative publish year per journal (the average year of references when compared to the published year of an article). As Hyland (2010) brought corpus analyses to identity studies (pp. 162–163), we aim to bring a corpus approach to the disciplinary history of writing studies.
